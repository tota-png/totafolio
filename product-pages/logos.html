						<div id="popup" class="popup-window" popover><p class="prod-story img-containing">The inspiration for the Chemathon logo came from 60's cartoons and overall midcentury style. The logo was printed out on shirts and used in all promotional materials for the yearly event organized by UF's Chemistry Department, which hosts high schools from around Florida for a day of science-themed competition.</p><div class="img-frame" id="rileyjump"><img src="../images/chemathon-draft.png"/></div><div class="extra-content"><img id="binca-chemathon" class="extra-img" src="../images/me-at-chemathon.png"/></div></div>

						<div id="popup1" class="popup-window" popover><p class="prod-story img-containing">The Florida Improv Fest (FIF) is a yearly gathering of Florida's collegiate improv teams for a weekend of workshops and improvisational comedy. UF was the host for the 2025 event, and I was tasked with creating a logo for the event. The logo was inspired by fruit stickers, of which there are many in Florida. Upon request from event organizers, a 3D version of the logo was designed using Blender 3D. This 3D version was used as the official logo for FIF.</p><div class="img-frame" id="rileyjump"><img id="tsf-img" src="../images/orangelogo.png"/></div></div>

						<div id="popup3" class="popup-window" popover><p class="prod-story img-containing">The FLACS logo was designed as an exercise to practice making more minimalist logos. It was intended to be a logo for the Florida Local Section of the American Chemical Society. On the right are a few rejected variants which were considered unbalanced and too juvenile, respectively. The thought process behind this logo can be seen below. Designed in the Fall of 2024. </p><div class="img-frame" id="rileyjump"><img src="../images/flacs-rejected.png"/></div><div class="extra-content"><img id="flacs-explain" class="extra-img" src="../images/flacs-thought.png"/></div></div>
