This page showcases some of the real works and conceptual products designed for the Department of Chemistry, the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and more. </p></div>

						<div id="popup" class="popup-window" popover><p class="prod-story non-image">In the Summer of 2024, the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the University of Florida announced a t-shirt competition for their upcoming "BMB Day." I designed a "cubist" portrait of the usual lab bench at the UF Genetics Institute, complete with liquid medium, falcon tubes, and many pipette tips. Because participation was too low, no shirt was made in the end, but the design remains one of my favorites.</p></div>
					<button popovertarget="popup2"><div class="img-frame"><img src="../images/ccshirt_post.png"/><p class="img-title">Chemistry Club Shirt</p></div></button>
						<div id="popup2" class="popup-window" popover><p class="prod-story img-containing">Part of the Chemistry Club's funding comes from the sale of club apparel. In 2023, as the club's Historian, I designed this t-shirt, hoping to bring a modern and playful look to the club. A t-shirt competition was held the following year, and another design (not pictured) was selected by club members as a whole. This illustration is still used in club listserv emails.</p><div class="img-frame" id="rileyjump"><img src="../images/cc-shirt-white.png"/></div><div class="extra-content"><img class="extra-img" src="../images/cc-shirt-progress.png"/></div></div>

						<div id="popup3" class="popup-window" popover><p class="prod-story non-image">While brainstorming potential merch items for the upcoming school year, the Chemistry Club considered selling totes to fund the club. Ultimately, none were made, but this was one of the designs I created. As a chapter of the American Chemical Society, we pride ourselves in promoting the principles of Green Chemistry, all of which are listed in this handy tote. Designed June 2024.</p></div>

						<div id="popup4" class="popup-window" popover><p class="prod-story img-containing">The "spaghettification" shirt was made to celebrate the end of the 2023-2024 school year. For some unknown reason, all club shirts thus far have been space themed, and this one was no exception. On the right are the Spring 2023 Short Form performers donning the illustrated shirt.</p><div class="img-frame" id="rileyjump"><img id="tsf-img" src="../images/riley-jump.png"/></div></div>
